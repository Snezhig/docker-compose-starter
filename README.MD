```
~/projects/docker-compose-starter$ ./init.sh

# Type the project name: docker_compose_starter
# Type the project path: /x/projects/docker-compose-starter
# Type the path to docker data: /x/projects/docker-compose-starter/docker/data
# Type the log path: /x/projects/docker-compose-starter/docker/logs
# Type database name: docker_db
# Type database user: docker_user
# Type database user password: docker_pass
# Type database root password: docker_root_pass
# Create public folder with index.php? Y

# FAQ
* Why there is `open-ssh-server` in php container?
    * I work on Windows I couldn't connect IDE with docker-compose, namely to give access to php interpreter to run tests from IDE, so I decided to connect by ssh to do it

# Features
## .env file
> Most of them understandable by name, but I will describe some
* `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`: used as a prefix for containers
* `PROJECT_PATH`: path for `project` volume. Will be filled by `init.sh`
* `LOGS_PATH`: path for `logs` volume. Will be filled by `init.sh`
* `DATA_PATH`: path for docker data (E.g database)
* `SET_UP_SSH_SERVER`: If it is true docker will install `ssh server` and runs it and php-frm by supervisord
* `XDEBUG_HOST`: `host.docker.internal` works for windows
